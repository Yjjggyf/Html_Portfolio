<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I take math seriously, but I laugh at my own mistakes first. If I solve a hard problem, I celebrate. If I miss an easy one, I stare at it like it betrayed me.</p>

<p>I once opened my laptop to study for five minutes. Three hours later, I had reorganized my folders, renamed files, and optimized my desktop layout. The studying started after that.</p>

<p>When I watch shows like Breaking Bad, Prison Break, or Money Heist, I pause scenes to predict the next move. Sometimes I get it right. When I do not, I act like the writers changed the script last minute.

My friends say I turn everything into a strategy game. Football, chess, even choosing seats in class. I call it planning. They call it overthinking.</p>
